## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. **Backend is Already Running** ✅
Your NestJS server is running with the Community API active.

```bash
# If not running:
cd server/server
npm run start:dev
```

Server available at: `http://localhost:3000`

### 2. **Database is Migrated** ✅
All community tables are created and ready.

```bash
# To check migration status:
npx prisma migrate status
```

### 3. **(Optional) Seed Sample Data**
Populate the database with test data:

```bash
cd server/server
npx ts-node scripts/seed-community.ts
```

This creates:
- 4 mentors (Arjun, Sneha, Vikram, Meera)
- 4 events (webinars, Q&A, networking)
- 3 success stories
- 4 resources
